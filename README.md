# Tab and spaces

I am a bot which detects files where tabs and spaces are mixed.

Most of the time, you won't notice them, as on your screen it looks just fine, and that is because the width of your tabulations is the same as the number of spaces per indentation of that file.
As soon as someone with another configuration opens you file, its indentation will look broken and reading it will be a pain.

I stand here to solve this. I will look through your repositories and post an issue telling you that there are mix-ups in your files.
To let me crawl in your repositories, simply follow me.

## Issues

If I made a mistake, then please tell me in the `Issues` of this repository.

To disable my alerts on a repository, comment on one of my issues (on your repository) with `Leave me alone` or `Leave us alone`.

## My rules

* I may look at your public repositories *if you follow me*.
* I may look at the public repositories you collaborate to *if you follow me*.
* I may **not** look at your private repositories.
* I may open issues on the repositories I may look at *if I have found any file with mixed tabs and spaces*.
* I may edit the issues mentioned above *if my scan indicates something different*.
* I may re-open issues on the repositories I may look at *if my previous issue was closed*.
* I may **not** do any of the above behaviours *if you have commented `Leave me alone` or `Leave us alone` on one of my comments*.
* I may **not** use any of your profile and repository data and/or contents for anything else than finding files with mixed tabs & spaces and opening/editing my report issue.

## Automatic corrections

I may do automatic corrections in the future. That is, I will open a pull request with un-mixed files.
